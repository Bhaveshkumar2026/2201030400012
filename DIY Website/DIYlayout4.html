        don't be afraid to pause and reassess if something isn't going as
        planned.

        <br />
        7. <big> Double-Check Measurements:</big> Measure twice, cut once!
        Double-check all measurements to ensure accuracy before making any cuts
        or installations. This simple step can help you avoid costly mistakes.
        <br />
        <br />
        8. <big> Work in a Clean Environment:</big> Keep your work area clean
        and organized to prevent accidents and make the project more manageable.
        Clear away clutter and debris as you go to maintain a safe and efficient
        workspace.
